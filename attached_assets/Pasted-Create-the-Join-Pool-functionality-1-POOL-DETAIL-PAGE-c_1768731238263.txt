Create the Join Pool functionality:

1. POOL DETAIL PAGE (client/src/pages/PoolDetail.tsx):

Create route: /pool/:id

PAGE LAYOUT:
- Same header (PARLAYZ logo, balance, sign out, back button)
- Pool card (larger version of browse card):
  * Title (large, bold)
  * Description (full text)
  * Status badge (OPEN/LOCKED/SETTLED)
  * Total pot: "KSh X,XXX"
  * Stake to enter: "KSh XXX"
  * Created by: @username

- Two columns showing outcomes with participant counts:
  * Left: Outcome 1 name (count)
  * Right: Outcome 2 name (count)
  * Show % split: "60% vs 40%"

- ENTRIES LIST:
  * Title: "Participants"
  * List all entries:
    - @username
    - Chose: [outcome]
    - Staked: KSh XXX
    - Badge if winner (after settlement)

- JOIN SECTION (if pool is open and user hasn't joined):
  * "Choose your prediction"
  * Radio buttons for outcome 1 and outcome 2
  * Gold "Join Pool - KSh XXX" button
  * Small text: "Current balance: KSh X,XXX"

- ALREADY JOINED MESSAGE (if user already in pool):
  * "You're in! 🎯"
  * Show their chosen outcome
  * "Waiting for more participants..." (if open)
  * "Pool locked. Results pending..." (if locked)

2. JOIN POOL LOGIC:

When user clicks "Join Pool":
- Validate user hasn't joined (check entries table)
- Validate balance >= stake_amount
- Validate pool status = 'open'
- Validate pool isn't full (if 1v1, check entry count < 2)

If valid:
- Show confirmation modal: "Join [pool title]? This will deduct KSh X from your balance."
- On confirm:
  a. Create entry in entries table
  b. Deduct stake from user's wallet_balance
  c. If 1v1 and now full (2 entries), auto-lock pool
  d. Show success message
  e. Refresh pool data

Error messages:
- "Insufficient balance. You need KSh XXX more."
- "You've already joined this pool!"
- "Pool is full"
- "Pool is no longer open"

3. ROUTING:
- Update App.tsx to add /pool/:id route
- Add navigation from browse cards to pool detail
- Make pool title clickable on browse page

4. REAL-TIME UPDATES (nice to have):
- When pool updates, refresh the page data
- Show live participant count
